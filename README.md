### Fixing existing translations

To fix existing translations, you can simply use the github editor to change the file in the `translations/` folder. This will automatically create a so called *pull request* which I then will review.

### Creating new translations

Please contact me before attempting to create a new translation. You can do so by visiting the discord or writing an email to feedback@yorg.io


After your translation has been approved, make sure to message me with your name so I can include it in the credits.

Thanks for contributing!
